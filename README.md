## Canvas Assignment

This is a simple application using the HTML5 Canvas element.  
I created 4 circles on the left side, each with a different color and arrows on the right pointing towards them.  
When you click on a circle, its corresponding arrow moves towards it and changes its color upon hitting.  
A reset button restores everything to the initial state.
